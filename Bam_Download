Used the following python module and script to download lists of the bam files per project ID:
https://hackmd.io/@astrobiomike/using-genelab-utils-to-download-GLDS-data  

Example use of the download module
**note - I had to download the python executable and run it directly even after loading the conda environment:
./GL-download-GLDS-data -g OSD-170 --just-get-file-info-table 

Filtered the lists with: 
grep bam OSD* | awk '{print $2}' | grep Col | grep -i aligned.sorted  > Col-0.files

Downloaded the resulting list of files:
wget -i Col-0.files -c

Ran this to rename the files:
for f in *.bam; do
    mv -- "$f" "${f#download?source=datamanager&file=}"
done
